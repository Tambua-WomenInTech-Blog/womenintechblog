Well if that\u0026rsquo;s the case then this is the place to be. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with React.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll get set up, explain the how\u0026rsquo;s and why\u0026rsquo;s behind the basic concepts and build a small project that displays data from an API. I am assuming that we have a little knowledge of JavaScript core concepts such as Asychronous programing, Promises, Hoisting, ES6 Syntax etc. If not visit here JavaScript Concepts That Every Developer Must Know to learn more.\nGrab a drink, buckle up and let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nSections Prerequisites Basic JavaScript Basic HTML Development Environment Creating a React App Exploring Create React App Our First Component JSX How a Component Gets Rendered Let\u0026rsquo;s Display Data Fetched From an API Prerequisites You don\u0026rsquo;t need to have any prior knowldge of React before reading this article, you however need to be familiar with a few things in order to get the most out of this guide.\nBasic JavaScript React is a JS library so it makes sense to know JavaSript before learning React right? Worry less, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to know Javscript extensively to learn React Js, just the basics.Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of some of the concepts you should be familiar with before learning React.\nVariables, functions and Data Types Asychronous Programming Arrays and Objects ES6 features and syntax DOM Manupulation Basic HTML In React we use JSX, which we will dive into later. But for now have a good grasp of HTML preferably HTML5.\nHow to structure HTML elements. HTML attributes such as class, id, onclick, href etc Development Environment The first thing we do before interacting with any programming language is to set up it\u0026rsquo;s developemt environment, React JS is no different. If you have Node JS and Visual Studio Code (or your preffered IDE) set up you can skip this section.\nNode JS Do I really need node to set up a React app? The answer is no. If you are a web developer that can handle HTML/CSS and JavaSCript you can try React without Node JS or any other complext tool to manage it. That\u0026rsquo;s your assignment.\nIn our case we need Node js. To download it visit this link and choose one that fit\u0026rsquo;s your machine.\nWhen the installation is complete, open your terminal and type\nnode -v This should show you the version of node that you have installed. The output should look something like: v16.7.0 Hurrraaaaaayy!!! Congratulations! You have completed the first step to getting started with React.\nVisual Studio Code VSC is a popular Open Source IDE for frontend development. There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of IDEs that you can try depending on your preference. For now we will run with Visual Studio Code.\nClick this link to download the version that suits your platform. That\u0026rsquo;s enough development set up for now.\nCreating a React App The next step is now creating a React app. Thank God for the folks at Facebook who made it easy for us to do that. All we to do is run this command in our terminal.\nThis creates a React project called my-app.\nOutput on the terminal Realize we\u0026rsquo;ve been directed on how to start our app\nRun these commands on your terminal, this will start a development server and open a web browser for you.\nWeb browser You;ve just set up your first React app, if you want to know more about what happens in the background visit this link Create React App\nExploring Create React App Here\u0026#39;s the file structure After running npx create-react-app yourApp, you will find your app root has three folders, node_modules/, public/, src/ and three files .gitignore, package.json, README.md and yarn.lock.\nRunning create-react-app Let\u0026rsquo;s break down what you just did. The first line in the output is from npx . There are two things npx can do when you give it the command. It first looks in your local machine for the package to run it. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t find one, it starts looking for npm\u0026rsquo;s package list. The first message in the output is just letting you know that it handled getting it.\nNext inside create-react-app, your command runs through a series of checks. It finds information about your system, looks for any flags attached and whether you specified a folder to output. Then the actual createApp function runs. This checks if the directory you choose is a safe one. It does this by looking for log files, if it fails any of this checks you will receive an error message.\nNext it begins to form a package.json file with the default values name: yourAppName, version: 0.1.0 and private: true. This is written to the directory you specified. Here it determines if it should use yarn or npm based on what you have in your machine. A series of checks are run on the version of npm/yarn, node version to select the correct version of react-scripts to use.\nThe next function is called run() . This continues the installation. Right now the only output you\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far is is the npx line \u0026ldquo;Creating a react app in \u0026rdquo;. The dependency list is created. By default this icludes react, react-dom and the version of react-scripts either from the internet if you are online or the local cache if you are not.\nThis is where you get the line installing react, react-dom and react scripts. The first thing it does is check if there\u0026rsquo;s package.json file and yarn.lock. It loads package.json file into a variable called appPackage in JSON format. It checks if TypeScript is a dependency after it does this. Next it begins adding to the JSON.\nFirst is the scripts, this will probably be familiar as start, build, eject and test. These are located in init.js file that we are currently going through. Next is the eslintConfig and defaultBrowsers. These are by default `\u0026gt;0.2%\u0026rsquo;,\u0026rsquo;not dead\u0026rsquo;, \u0026rsquo;not ie \u0026lt;= 11\u0026rsquo;,\u0026rsquo;not op_mini all\u0026rsquo;. Basically this means target all browsers that are higher than .2% market share, in active use, not below IE 11 or Opera Mini.This is a seperate package located in package.json. You can find it Here . The package.json file is written out and will not be changed again. At this point there\u0026rsquo;s no output yet, a README.md file is checked and if it exists it is renamed. The files specified in the template folder are then copied to a working directory. This is the public, README.me, src and gitignore. gitignore is copied without the . infront then renamed, this is to prevent an npm bug. After a check to see if React is installed, it moves to check if the repository has been initialized with git. These runs git init, and adds the first commit. This is where the line Initialized a git repository comes from. The last thing init.js does before ending the process is print the success message and instructions. These introduce you to basic react scripts commands and suggest you cd into your app directory to run your application.\nIndex.html This is the entry file, the first thing that the web browser loads when a user navigates to your app. If you look at the file, it\u0026rsquo;s just a normal HTML file that you\u0026rsquo;re hopefully familiar with. If you look at the body, it\u0026rsquo;s empty. React dynamically convert our React code into HTML and load it here, in the div with id \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;. With that out of the way let\u0026rsquo;s get to the juicy part.\nOur First Component Open up our App.js component, this is the main component in our application. It is the first component to be rendered, the icing to our cake. The first thing we are going to do with our icing is remove all the code so that we build our component from scratch so that we better understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Now that we have a nice and clean slate,we will start by importing react\nimport react from 'react';\nNext we declare a function, we will use ES6 arrow function here. That\u0026rsquo;s more or less what a component is\u0026hellip;A function with some logic and markup ( In this case JSX ). We are also going to export this function so we can use it elsewhere.\nconst App = () =\u0026gt;{ } export default App; Within this code we write a return() statement, that is what get\u0026rsquo;s returned from this component, and contains our markup that get\u0026rsquo;s rendered inform of HTMl. Finally let\u0026rsquo;s add a div with an h1 title tag. Our finished component looks like this:\nconst App = () =\u0026gt;{ return( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Our First React App\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;This is our first react app, isn\u0026#39;t it amazing!!!!\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ) } Now you are probably thinking, Whoah!! HTML in a function? Even though it looks like HTML, it\u0026rsquo;s something called JSX( JavaScript XML ).It allows us to mix JavaScript and HTML. This might seem a littel peculiar cause we started learning front-end development by seperating HTML and JavaScript( and even CSS ). That is where libaries come in, to keep things together and to make writing code easier.Keeping everything together in the same component makes it easier to maintain and reuse the code. Let\u0026rsquo;s see that in action. Run this command in your terminal npm run start This should open the browser and you should be able to see your application running. Voila!! You just created your first component.\nJSX Let\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper into JSX, you probably have some questions lingering.\nreturn( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Our First React App\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;This is our first react app, isn\u0026#39;t it amazing!!!!\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); This looks like HTML and it\u0026rsquo;s not. It\u0026rsquo;s JSX! Evn though it looks like normal HTML but it\u0026rsquo;s not, React is creating the element tree using the following syntax: React.createElement(component,props,...children)\ncomponent: The HTML element you wish to create i.e div, h1 props: Any props you wish to pass to the component children: An array of HTML Elements nested within a component. So the same component we just created can be written as: const App = ()=\u0026gt;{ return( React.createElement(\u0026#39;div\u0026#39;, null, React.createElement(\u0026#39;h1\u0026#39;,null, \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;), React.createElement(\u0026#39;div\u0026#39;, null, React.createElement(\u0026#39;h1\u0026#39;,null, \u0026#34;This is our first react app, isn\u0026#39;t it amazing!!!!\u0026#34;)) ); } This is a whole lot to type right? It looks messy. If you trace through it you will realize we are creating a div which has no props passed to it and has other elements created inside it which are h1 and h2. If you\u0026rsquo;ve interacted with JavaScript a lot you\u0026rsquo;ll realize that it a lot similar to document.createElement after all this is a JavaScript library. This is the beauty of JSX, it allows you to write JavaScript and HTML without going through the hustle of React.createElement(). React developers almost exclusively use JSX, this section was important to understand what happens under the hood.\nMaking things dynamic Why use JSX when you can just write HTML and get away with it? Well if we remember what JSX stands for( JavaScript XML ). This means we can use JavaScript to make things dynamic. Our previous example looks like so:\nconst App = () =\u0026gt;{ return( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Our First React App\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;This is our first react app, isn\u0026#39;t it amazing!!!!\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ) } Now let\u0026rsquo;s make it dynamic. Create a variable message to hold our message. const message = 'This is our first react app, isn't it amazing!!!!'; Now to add JavaScript to use this, we use curlybraces {}.\nconst App = ()=\u0026gt;{ const message = \u0026#39;This is our first react app, isn\u0026#39;t it amazing!!!!\u0026#39;; return( \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Our First React App\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{ message }\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; ) } If you run this in your terminal you will see the output. Now go ahead and change the message and see magic! We use curly braces to tell the compiler \u0026ldquo;execute this code in JavaScript\u0026rdquo;. If we didn\u0026rsquo;t have the curly braces the message wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be executed as JavaScript, and instead the text \u0026lsquo;message\u0026rsquo; would be displayed on your browser.\nHow a component gets rendered. Hopefully, I have cleared all the questions you have about JSX and creating components plus making them dynamic. I know you still asking yourself how these components get rendered right? This section will clear that up. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at our file structure, notice index.html , this is always considered an entry file, to most developers if not all. You can change the entry point if you wish. For now we will leave it as is. Focus on this line of code\nReactDOM.render(\u0026lt;App /\u0026gt;, document.getElementById(\u0026#34;root\u0026#34;)); Notice we have document.getElementById(\u0026quot;root\u0026quot;); finally some normal looking JavaScript. This gets the root element from the DOM using plain JavaScript and renders our App component within it. Our App component is imported like so: import App from './App'; Remember we exported App from our App component. This lets other files or components use App component. The root element comes from index.html file from our folder called public/ . As mentioned earlier, index.html is the file that gets rendered when the application loads. Within it we have a div with an id root which is empty and where our React components get rendered. Let\u0026rsquo;s open our dev tools and have a look.\nOutput in the console Let\u0026rsquo;s display data fetched from an API Wuuuuh wuuuh!! This is the most interesting part, in JavaScript there\u0026rsquo;ll always be data to be fetched and dislplayed because you constantly have to communicate with the backend. We will not dive in too deep. We will use fetch API. Fetch API uses Promise to deliver more flexible features to make requests to servers from web browsers. In addition it is much simpler and cleaner compared to XMLHttpRequests. The fetch() is available in global scope which instructs the web browsers to make requests.\nSending a request The fetch() only requires one parameter which is the url for the resources you want to fetch. let response = fetch(url); The fetch() returns a Promise so you can use then and catch to handle it.\nfetch(url) .then(response =\u0026gt; { //Handle response }) .catch(error =\u0026gt;{ //Handle error }); When the response completes the response is available. At this time, the Promise will resolve into Response object. The Response object is the API wrapper for the fetched url resources. The Response object has a number of useful properties and methods to inspect the response. Let\u0026rsquo;s get right into the juice. Visit this link to get some free APIs. Choose any that you please. In our case we will use Cat facts APIs. I love cats!!\nimport \u0026#34;./App.css\u0026#34;; import React from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; const App = () =\u0026gt; { let catFact = {}; let fact = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; const fetchAPI = () =\u0026gt; { fetch(\u0026#34;https://catfact.ninja/fact\u0026#34;) .then((response) =\u0026gt; { return response.json(); }) .then(data =\u0026gt;{ catFact = data; fact = catFact.fact; console.log( catFact ); console.log(fact); }) .catch((err) =\u0026gt; console.log(err)) }; fetchAPI(); return ( \u0026lt;div className=\u0026#34;App\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;First React App!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); }; export default App; To your previous code, add the above snippet and open your console to view your data. Now as an assignment work on displaying the data on your browser. There are better libararies used to fetch APIs such as axios.Here\u0026rsquo;s a link to a comprehensive view of axios React has a good documentation showing a step to step guide. Check it out here. See you on the next blog when we talk about props.

It happens twice each year(in Summer and Winter) and targets people underrepresented in tech.I participated in the Outreachy Internship program during the 2018 Winter round. Applications usually open around February for the Summer round and September for the Winter round.\nI first heard of Outreachy from a friend who had previously participated in the program. The reason why I decided to apply to the program is because I love open source and would like to work in open source in future, so Outreachy was a great place to get started and the experience would be good for my career generally. I signed up and went through the information on the website about the internship months before the applications were opened. I also signed up for a newsletter which informs you when the applications open. I went through past projects and organizations which gave me an idea of some the organizations which I would like to apply to. There are blogs from past interns talking about their application processes and they also offer tips on what worked based on their experiences. I read some of these which gave me an idea on what to expect. When the internship applications opened, I got an email telling me so :mailbox:\nApplication Steps The first step of the application process is the initial/eligibility application. This consists of a number of questions which help Outreachy organizers determine if you are eligible for Outreachy mainly based on on your availability during the internship period and if you are underreprented in tech spaces in your area. I submitted my initial application had to wait a few days as my proposal was reviewed and decided on if I was eligible for the program. After I got the go ahead, I looked through the projects to find the ones I could apply to. I selected three projects that I had interest on. I started looking in the code base and entered their communication channels to find more information about the projects. Other projects were still being added to the website and about two weeks in, I saw that Public Lab plots2 project was added in the list of projects.\nI had an experience with Public Lab community before, I researched further and totally resonated with what they do. Public Lab is a community and non-profit democratizing science to address environmental issues that affect people. It is a platform where you can post your research, open source it for others to use and also find information you need to solve your environmental and social injustices. There is so much more on Public lab. Plus the code community is welcoming and ready to help. I love what Public Lab does and after I saw it listed I knew that is exactly what I would like to work on so I focused on it. You are required to pick 1-2 projects and apply to.\nTo be eligible for selection to a project, you have to make contributions to the project, there is around three weeks set aside for making contributions. I browsed through the issues and started working on some. The code community was supportive throughout the process. The pull requests got reviewed fast and the community was willing to help in case of any questions/ blockers. I started drafting my proposal early and when the deadline was approching I refined it, recorded my contributions and submitted.\nIf you are hesistant to apply to a project, my advice is just go for it. I was quite scared of applying too. The worst thing that could happen is you will contribute to the open source project during the application process and learn a lot in the process if don\u0026rsquo;t get selected. Also all the experience you get from applying could help you improve and reapply the following round.\nTips 📝 You could signup for the Outreachy mailing list to be notified when the applications open. You could also follow Outreachy on twitter they also update there when applications open. Pick a project or two and start contributing to them early enough. Once you join an organization\u0026rsquo;s channel introduce yourself so mentors can get to know you. Do not be scared to ask for help, mentors are there and always willing to help. Take time to research on your project and start drafting your proposal early. Do not forget to record your contributions on the Outreachy website.

Ever wondered whether you should use a trigger or a constraint to enforce a database rule? well, this has happened to me severally and I have sometimes made the mistake of using a trigger where a simple constraint would have worked perfectly. There are various factors to consider when you are trying to figure out which of the two you need, depending of course on what you are trying to achieve.\nPostgreSQL Triggers Triggers are functions that are invoked automatically whenever a certain operation is performed on a table, the functions are invoked either before or after an operation is performed. Operations in this case can be INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE. More information about triggers and how they operate can be found here\nPostgreSQL constraints Constraints are a way to limit the kind of data that can be stored in a table beyond the datatype restriction. For example, if a column is defined to contain strings. This article will focus on the check constraint. A check constraint can be used to define the exact strings that are expected. Anything other than what is expected will throw an error.\nSo how do you decide? The Use Cases outlined below are based on my experiences working with PostgreSQL as well as research, I believe it will be of use to you whether you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a solution or just doing research.\nCommon Uses of triggers Cascading various Operations If an operation on one table should have an effect on a different table, then a trigger would be perfect to use in that scenario. E.g If an UPDATE operation on one table causes one or more rows of another table to be updated. The same applies to the other two operations mentioned above. Cascading various operations can be helpful in keeping audits of various activities in your application(automatically).\nInserting data that depends on data from a different table. A BEFORE INSERT trigger can be used to verify data from one or more columns of the record you are trying to insert.\nNotify the application of database events If you prefer to handle most of your business logic on the application rather than on the database level. An option you can consider is to listen for database events from the application and once an operation occurs on the database, The application will be notified and you will be able to handle the event.\nCommon Uses of Check Constraints Constraints are basically used whenever you need to add restrictions based on your business rules/ business logic. Constraints should not change, unless of course, the business rules also change.\nConstraints are used to add restriction on a specific table as they are limited to only access the the columns of one table at a time. If your record depends on data from another table, you are better off using a Trigger. Therefore, It would be ideal to enforce the simpler restrictions using constraints.\nCheck constraints can be used to achieve data integrity by specifying the type of data allowed into a table.\nOn top of the above, please feel free to visit the official PostgreSQL documentation for more information as well as guides.\nTHE END\n","date":"15 May, 2021","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/hero/pollet-obuya/postgresql-triggers-vs-constraints/hero_hu2e3ab466689818ac6165158e6dbe555a_44630_545x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/hero/pollet-obuya/postgresql-triggers-vs-constraints/hero_hu2e3ab466689818ac6165158e6dbe555a_44630_600x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/hero/pollet-obuya/postgresql-triggers-vs-constraints/hero_hu2e3ab466689818ac6165158e6dbe555a_44630_700x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource srcset=\"/images/hero/pollet-obuya/postgresql-triggers-vs-constraints/hero_hu2e3ab466689818ac6165158e6dbe555a_44630_1110x0_resize_q95_h2_box.webp\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"w-100 img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/images/hero/pollet-obuya/postgresql-triggers-vs-constraints/hero_hu2e3ab466689818ac6165158e6dbe555a_44630_1110x0_resize_q95_box.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"470\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/postgresql-triggers-vs-constraints/","tags":["Postresql","SQL","Triggers","Constraints"],"title":"Postgresql Triggers vs Constraints"},{"categories":["Database Management"],"contents":"Introduction Have you ever accidentally dropped a table or a Column from a production Database and wondered how you would revert the Changes? You can imagine how things can get tough on your side 😃. This can be one of the most scary moments for a Database administrator or even a software developer held up to task with this. If this ever happens,don’t worry, here is where Liquibase comes in with its Rollback support feature.\nWhat’s Liquibase? Liquibase is an open-source database schema change management solution that enables you to manage revisions of your database changes easily.\nBut How does it work? Liquibase uses changeSets to represent a single change to your database. A changeSet is what you use to group databases together and is a unit of change that Liquibase executes on a database.\nA changeLog is a list of changes created by multiple changeSets But how does Liquibase identify a change set?A ChangeSet is identified by 3 elements: “ID” and “author” and the path of ChangeLog file name.\nLiquibase allows you to perform the following: Rollback Support : You can use liquibase.bat rollback to undo an update, since it allows you to roll back changeSets based on number of changeSets,to a given date, or to a given tag stored in the database.Rollback change for specific versions without needing to know what has already been deployed.\nAutomatic updates: rather than executing updates or rollbacks directly against the database, you can generate the SQL that would be ran for inspection and/or manual execution.\nFuture Rollback Output: Before you apply an update to a database, you can generate the SQL you would need to run in order to bring the database back to the state it is in now for inspection.\nChangeSet Contexts: ChangeSets can be assigned “contexts” in which to run. Contexts are selected at runtime and can be used to have changeSets that only run in test instances or other unique circumstances\nChangeLog and ChangeSet preconditions: Preconditions can be added to the changeLog or individual changeSets to check the state of the database before attempting to execute them.\nChangeSet checksums: When a changeSet is executed, Liquibase stores a checksum and can fail or alter execution if it detects a change between the original definition of a changeSet when it was run and the current definition.\nDifference Support: Although Liquibase is built to use database comparisons for change management, there is support for it in Liquibase which is helpful in many cases such as performing sanity checks between databases.\nYou can also use Liquibase with an existing Database, to get started, look up for this here. Also checkout additional LiquiBase tips from Baeldung.\nTo set up Liquibase, check the following link from official documentation\nDiagram Flow of Liquibase Operation. Liquibase identifies the Database type and different ChangeSets from which it prepares SQL statement from the Database ChangeLogs.\nWhen you run Liquibase for the first time, it creates the DataBaseChangeLog, DataBaseChangeLock for tracking DB changes and execute SQL Queries on Target Databases\nWhen you issue a Liquibase update command, Liquibase will go through Changelog file to see if there are some ChangeSets that have not been updated in the DataBaseChangeLog. If found, it executes them and place the updated record in the table getting you to the latest revision of the structure you are defining. Rather than writing SQL directly against the database to create, update or drop database objects, desired database changes can be written in different format like in XML,SQL, YAML, JSON.\nChangeSet Example in a YAML format - changeSet: id: 1 author: josephine changes: - addColumn: tableName: person columns: - column: name: username type: varchar(10) ChangeSet Examples in XML format - changeSet: id: 1 author: josephine changes: - addColumn: tableName: person columns: - column: name: username type: varchar(10) ChangeSet Examples in XML format \u0026lt;changeSet id=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; author=\u0026#34;josephine\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;addColumn tableName=\u0026#34;person\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=\u0026#34;username\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;varchar(10)\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/addColumn\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/changeSet\u0026gt; Checkout using SQL and JSON formats in this link below\nhttps://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/basic/sql-format.html\nLiquibase Use Case example In this example am going to showcase how to use Liquibase Rollback feature to undo a Liquibase Database Operation and rollback(revert) to previous database version tag say version 1.0. (Also, Liquibase can roll back without tags). To run liquibase using maven, you need:\nAdd `liquibase-maven-plugin in pom file\nTo run liquibase using Gradle, you need:\nAdd liquibase-gradle-plugin in build.gradle file,\nTo run liquibase in command line download liquibase, unpack its executable file liquibase or liquibase.bat in the package.Download your database jdbc driver to you local disk.\nYou can choose either command line, gradle plugin or maven plugin to run liquibase, whichever suits you.\nCategories of Liquibase Operations Automatic Rollback : Database migrations can automatically generate steps required for rolling back. Such change-types includecreate table, rename column, and add column.\nManual Rollback : A rollback command is placed manually because automatic migration instructions cannot be used to identify the statement. Such Change types include drop table and insert data. For these cases you can specify the rollback commands via the tag within the changeset tag. You can use an empty tag if you don’t want anything done to undo a change in rollback mode.\nSamples For instance the image below represents the current DataBase version say 1.1 , where I renamed the Student column to students_name and now I would wish to revert the changed Column name to the previous 1.0 version where I had labelled it as name.\nYou can specify the rollback changes in three ways:\n1. Tag This entails specifying a tag to rollback to, which will revert all change-sets that were executed against the target database after the given tag was applied. Here is an example using Maven Command:\nmvn liquibase:rollback -Dliquibase.rollbackTag=1.0 2. Number of Change Sets You can also rollback by specifying the number of change-sets that needs to rollback. Here is an example using Maven Command:\nmvn liquibase:rollback -Dliquibase.rollbackCount=1 3. Date The date of the roll back can be specified such that the changesets executed after that day will be rolled back.\nHere is an example using Maven Command:\nmvn liquibase:rollback \u0026#34;-Dliquibase.rollbackDate=Aug 10, 2020\u0026#34; Uses of rollback statement in changesets. There are ways we can use rollback statements in Changesets below are examples:\ni). Multiple RollBack Tags It’s possible to have more than one rollback tags in a changeset, However they are executed in the order by which they appear in the changeset:\n\u0026lt;changeSet id=”multipleRollbackTags” author=\u0026#34;josephine\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;createTable tableName=”person\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”id” type=”int”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”username” type=”varchar(30)”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/createTable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;createTable tableName=”occupation\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”id” type=”int”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”career_path” type=”varchar(30)”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/createTable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rollback\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dropTable tableName=”person\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/rollback\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rollback\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dropTable tableName=”occupation\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/rollback\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/changeSet\u0026gt; ii). Multistatement RollBack A single rollback tag may enclose more than one statements to be executed where we drop two tables in the same rollback tag.\n\u0026lt;changeSet id=\u0026#34;multiStatementRollback\u0026#34; author=\u0026#34;josephine\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;createTable tableName=”person\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”id” type=”int”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”username” type=”varchar(30)”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/createTable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;createTable tableName=”occupation\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”id” type=”int”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”career_path” type=”varchar(30)”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/createTable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rollback\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dropTable tableName=\u0026#34;person\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dropTable tableName=\u0026#34;occupation\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/rollback\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/changeSet\u0026gt; iii). ChangeSet referrals for Rollback We can refer to another ChangeSet, possibly the original ChangeSet if we are going to change some details in the database. This will reduce the code duplication and can correctly revert the done changes:\n\u0026lt;changeSet id=”referChangeSetForRollback” author=\u0026#34;josephine\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dropTable tableName=”person\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dropTable tableName=”occupation\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rollback changeSetId=”multiStatementRollback” changeSetAuthor=\u0026#34;josephine\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/changeSet\u0026gt; iv). Empty RollBack Tag By default, Liquibase tries to generate a rollback script if we have not provided. If we need to break this feature, we can have empty rollback tag so that rollback operation is not get reverted:\n\u0026lt;changeSet id=”emptyRollback” author=”josephine”\u0026gt; \u0026lt;createTable tableName=”occupation”\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”id” type=”int”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”career_path” type=”varchar(30)”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;column name=”author” type=”varchar(30)”/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/createTable\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rollback/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/changeSet\u0026gt; NB: We can also use the rollbackOneChangeSet command which reverts one non-sequential changeset made during a previous change to your database which is only available for Liquibase Pro users.

You might have fallen in love with flutter just like me, after periodical advances probably from Conference’s speakers, latest tech news, rumours from friends or even colleagues and you are wondering or maybe stranded where to start up from. Well, here are a few guides on how to start up on flutter.\n1. First step is to get a basic idea of what flutter really is. What is flutter? Flutter is an open-source cross-platform mobile application SDK developed by Google. It is used to develop both Android and iOS applications. Flutter is written in Dart language. Those familiar with Object-Oriented Languages such as Java, Javascript, Objective C or Swift can easily relate to Dart.\nWhy Flutter? Saves companies the need to employ different iOS and Android developers to build the same app since it supports cross-platforms development. Eliminates building same interface twice hence saving time Allows you to experience native look and feel of mobile applications Allows you create 2D effects ,games and animation High velocity development giving the hot reload feature 2. Development Platforms After having a basic idea of what flutter is, you might be eager to know about the development platforms to use. Well if you are from Android or iOS, you are probably familiar with Android Studio and Xcode. Flutter requires Flutter SDK just like Android requires Android SDK. The IDEs to be used are:\nAndroid Studio VScode Xcode You could check this Getting Started with Flutter on steps on how to set up Flutter on your favourable editor.\n3. Learn about this beautiful language - Dart The next thing before diving into flutter, learn about Dart. Dart will take you through the Object Oriented Programming concepts that you need to grasp like variables, classes, methods, functions, Operators, Control flow statements, Exceptions like throw, catch, finally and Data types like Strings, Maps, Lists among others.\nYou could check Getting Started with Dart to get started on Dart Language.\nYou can also use this online editor Dart Pad to practice on the Dart language.\n4. Write your first Flutter App After going through the basic OOP programming concepts like looping, functions, variables, classes, and conditional statements, you are now confident enough to start up your first Flutter Application. Everything in flutter is a widget including screens,texts, graphics, Containers etc. UI design in Flutter involves creating widgets. You can check out Flutter Codelab to start up your first hello world flutter app. You can either use your phone or an emulator to run your app using the command flutter run.\n5. Google Codelabs. This involves step by step procedures to code challenges. It is interesting because it is very practical, you can follow along the codelabs and maybe later on tweak to your own way. You can check them out at Google Codelabs 6. Udemy Flutter Course Stephen Grider’s flutter Udemy course is simple to learn and understand. He breaks down the video into simple understandle chanks. Check udemy.com\n7. Udacity Flutter Course. Google also offers free Flutter Udacity course. You could go through this to get a sneak peak of how flutter apps work. You could do this practically to enhance your understanding. Checkout: Udacity Flutter Course 8. MTechViral youtube videos. You could watch MTechViral to get a glimpse of flutter tutorials. These helps in building your scope of knowledge in flutter.Checkout: MTechViral youtube videos. 9. Attempt Code Challenges After passing the above steps, you are probably able to understand Dart syntax. Attempting code challenges assists in testing your ability to break down a problem into small steps and finding solutions to them. You can sign up for CodeWars/Kata challenges at Flutter Code Challenges to test your Dart language summary. The more you attempt the challenges,the more you will be eager to gain more points and this sparks interest in programming.\n10. Gitter You can join the gitter chat to get connected with people who have had hands-on experience with Flutter. You can ask questions about what you are not able to solve, to get opinionated answers that might be helpful. Checkout: Gitter 11. GitHub Repositories. After getting a basic idea about flutter and having understood the basic concept, you can check on git hub through: Flutter GitHub Repositories 12. Flutter Weekly. To get new weekly insights about flutter, flutter weekly says it all. It delivers information about latest flutter news, latest flutter articles and flutter jobs among others. Flutter Weekly and Flutter Weekly Twitter on twitter.\n13. Join Slack Flutter Communities Joining slack communities will enhance your confidence in flutter . This helps in sharing and by sharing you gain a lot. You can join Flutter Communities Slack 14. Follow the Official @flutterio handle on Twitter Follow the official @flutterio twitter handle and @r_FlutterDev to get the latest updates on twitter and opportunities.
