# Introduction

Flutter is one of the latest Google’s hot-chic. You might have fallen in love with flutter just like me, after periodical advances probably from Conference’s speakers, latest tech news, rumours from friends or even colleagues and you are wondering or maybe stranded where to start up from. Well, here are a few guides on how to start up on flutter.

# 1. First step is to get a basic idea of what flutter really is.
# What is flutter?

Flutter is an open-source cross-platform mobile application SDK developed by Google. It is used to develop both Android and iOS applications. Flutter is written in Dart language. Those familiar with Object-Oriented Languages such as Java, Javascript, Objective C or Swift can easily relate to Dart.

# Why Flutter?

   * Saves companies the need to employ different iOS and Android developers to build the same      app since it supports cross-platforms development.
   * Eliminates building same interface twice hence saving time
   * Allows you to experience native look and feel of mobile applications
   * Allows you create 2D effects ,games and animation
   * High velocity development giving the hot reload feature 

# 2. Development Platforms

After having a basic idea of what flutter is, you might be eager to know about the development platforms to use. Well if you are from Android or iOS, you are probably familiar with Android Studio and Xcode. Flutter requires Flutter SDK just like Android requires Android SDK. The IDEs to be used are:

  * Android Studio
  * VScode
  * Xcode 

You could check this https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor on steps on how to set up your favourable editor.

# 3. Learn about this beautiful language - Dart

The next thing before diving into flutter, learn about Dart. Dart will take you through the Object Oriented Programming concepts that you need to grasp like variables, classes, methods, functions, Operators, Control flow statements, Exceptions like throw, catch, finally and Data types like Strings, Maps, Lists among others.
