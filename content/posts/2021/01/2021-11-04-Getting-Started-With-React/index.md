I can almost bet on it that you've fallen in love with JavaScript and want to dive deeper into learning some of it's libaries and frameworks. Well if that's the case then this is the place to be. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with React.

We'll get set up, explain the how's and why's behind the basic concepts and build a small project that displays data from an API. I am assuming that we have a little knowledge of JavaScript core concepts such as Asychronous programing, Promises, Hoisting, ES6 Syntax etc. If not visit here [<span style="color:blue"> **JavaScript Concepts That Every Developer Must Know** </span>]( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/) to learn more.

Grab a drink, buckle up and let's get started!

## Prerequisites


You don't need to have any prior knowldge of React before reading this article, you however need to be familiar with a few things in order to get the most out of this guide.

#### Basic JavaScript


React is a JS library so it makes sense to know JavaSript before learning React right? Worry less, you __don't__ need to know Javscript extensively to learn React Js, just the basics.Here's a list of some of the concepts you should be familiar with before learning React.
- Variables, functions and Data Types
- Asychronous Programming
- Arrays and Objects
- ES6 features and syntax
- DOM Manupulation

#### Basic HTML

In React we use JSX, which we will dive into later. But for now have a good grasp of HTML preferably HTML5.

- How to structure HTML elements.
- HTML attributes such as class, id, onclick, href etc
